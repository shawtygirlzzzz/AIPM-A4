# Data Folder

This directory stores all datasets used in the project.

## Structure
- **raw/** – Contains original, unmodified data.
- **processed/** – Contains cleaned and prepared data ready for analysis or modeling.

## Notes
Do not modify files in the `raw` folder. Processed data should be generated via scripts in `/src/`.
