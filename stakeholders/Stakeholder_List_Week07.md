## Stakeholder Engagement Strategy (Power-Interest Analysis)

### 1. High Power / High Interest (Manage Closely)
**Stakeholder:** Course Lecturer.
**Strategy:** Treat as the primary client. Ensure all administrative submissions (WBS, Reports) are submitted to ULearn on time and follow the specific formatting guidelines.

### 2. High Power / Low Interest (Keep Satisfied)
**Stakeholder:** UTeM Administration.
**Strategy:** Ensure all documentation follows the standard university format and that the project adheres to academic integrity policies (no plagiarism).

### 3. Low Power / High Interest (Keep Informed)
**Stakeholder:** Project Manager & Development Team.
**Strategy:** Conduct daily stand-ups via MS Teams to track the WBS tasks. Use GitHub for continuous code integration and issue tracking to keep everyone updated on technical changes.

### 4. Low Power / Low Interest (Monitor)
**Stakeholder:** End Users.
**Strategy:** Minimal engagement during development. We will engage them primarily during the "Testing and Validation" phase (Week 7 in WBS) to gather usability feedback.
