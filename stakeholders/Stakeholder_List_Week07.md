## Stakeholder Engagement Strategy (Power-Interest Analysis)


### 1. High Power / High Interest (Manage Closely)
* **Stakeholder:** Course Coordinator.
* **Strategy:** Ensure all administrative submissions (WBS, Reports) are submitted to ULearn on time and follow the specific formatting guidelines.

### 2. Low Power / High Interest (Keep Informed)
* **Stakeholder:** Development Team & Project Manager.
* **Strategy:** Daily stand-ups via MS Teams and continuous updates via GitHub commits. Maintain a high frequency of technical discussion.

### 3. Low Power / Low Interest (Monitor)
* **Stakeholder:** End Users.
* **Strategy:** Engage during the "Validation" phase (Week 7.2 in WBS) for feedback. Until then, monitor general requirements but do not engage frequently.
