**1.Reallocation of Human Resources from Non-Critical Tasks**

The Model Training phase has the highest concentration of human cost due to intensive hours and specialist involvement. To mitigate delays or cost escalation, human resources from lower-risk or near-completion tasks (such as documentation preparation or frontend refinement) should be temporarily reassigned to support data preprocessing and model training activities. This action maximizes the use of existing manpower without increasing the total project budget and ensures that critical technical components are completed on time.

**2. Scope Refinement and Cost Control on Model Development**

Given that data preparation and model training contribute significantly to overall expenditure, the project scope should be refined to focus only on essential model features required to meet project objectives. Optional enhancements or advanced model tuning can be deferred to a later phase if time or cost constraints persist. This corrective action helps contain costs within the allocated RM 1,005 budget while still delivering a functional and evaluable AI system.
