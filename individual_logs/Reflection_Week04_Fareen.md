## Reflection

### 1. Which phase of your project had the most subtasks?
The Development phase contained the most subtasks as it involved creating several components including the Telegram bot, NLP model, backend API and Streamlit dashboard. Each component required careful coordination and integration, making this phase the most detailed and time-consuming.

### 2. How did breaking tasks down help you plan better?
Breaking tasks down help me plan better by segmenting the project and the schedule became highly structured and achievable.This division was key in identifying prerequisite tasks for instance, the data preparation had to precede the model training and ensured that each person's work was distinct and focused.

### 3. What would you adjust in your project schedule next week?
Next week I plan to ensure the dashboard development would be complete on time.
