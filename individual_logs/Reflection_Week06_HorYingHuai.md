## Reflection
### 1. Which quality criterion do you think will be hardest to achieve?
The most challenging quality requirement will be achieving ≥ 90% accuracy for intent recognition. This depends heavily on dataset size and diversity, and performance may vary across different command types such as reminders, task creation, and date extraction.

### 2. Which risk poses the greatest threat to your project and why?
The most significant risk is R2 – model accuracy not meeting the minimum threshold. Without a reliable model, the Telegram bot will frequently misunderstand user commands, leading to a poor user experience and undermining the core purpose of the AI To-Do List Assistant.

### 3. How does quality management support project success?
Quality management ensures the project maintains structure, consistency, and measurable standards. It reduces rework, improves model robustness, prevents integration issues, and ensures the final system is reliable for real users.
