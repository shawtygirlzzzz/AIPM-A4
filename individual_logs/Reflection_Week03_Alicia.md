## Reflection
### 1. What did I contribute this week?  
This week I helped set up the `/planning/` folder in our GitHub repository and ensured that the project scope document was properly structured in Markdown. I also worked on drafting the initial project plan in Excel, including task durations and dependencies, and uploaded it for the team to review.  

### 2. What did I learn about collaboration or planning?  
I learned how important it is to break down tasks into smaller milestones and visualize them in a Gantt chart. Using GitHub for version control and MS Teams for communication made it easier to keep everyone aligned. I also realized that documenting scope clearly helps avoid confusion later in the project.  

### 3. What challenges did I face?  
The main challenge was getting familiar with MS Project and understanding how to link dependencies correctly. At first, the timeline didn’t align with our intended schedule, so I had to adjust task durations and dependencies carefully. Another challenge was making sure the GitHub repo structure was consistent for everyone.  

### 4. What will I focus on next week?  
Next week I will focus on refining the task breakdown for the development phase, especially the Telegram bot and Streamlit dashboard components. I also plan to improve my understanding of scheduling tools so that I can update the project plan more efficiently as the project progresses.
