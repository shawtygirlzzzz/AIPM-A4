## Reflection - Week 08

### 1. What planning activity helped most in monitoring progress?
[cite_start]The **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** created in Week 05 was the most helpful tool for monitoring our progress[cite: 134]. Because we broke the project down into small, specific packages (like "Data Labeling" vs. "Data Cleaning" instead of just "Data"), I could pinpoint exactly *where* the Development Team was stuck. Without that granularity, we might have just realized "Development is slow" without knowing the root cause was specifically the labeling workload.

### 2. What would you do differently in future projects?
[cite_start]In future projects, I would allocate a specific **"Technical Buffer"** for API integrations[cite: 135]. We assumed the Telegram API would work instantly, but configuration issues cost us a week. I would also set up a "Proof of Concept" (POC) for critical integrations in Week 1, rather than waiting until the middle of the execution phase to try connecting the bot for the first time.
