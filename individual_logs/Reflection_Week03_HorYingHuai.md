## Reflection

### 1. What was the most challenging part of building the schedule?
The hardest part was to estimate how long each task would actually take because tasks like "Data Collection" and "Model Training" can be unpredictable.

### 2. How did GitHub and Teams support your collaboration?
The tools worked together perfectly. GitHub ensured that everyone had the latest version of our project plan, while Teams enabled us for quick chats, sharing screenshots and getting instant feedback which saved us from sending many emails back and forth.

### 3. What tasks will you refine next week?
Next week, our plan is to break down the big tasks into smaller and more specific tasks. For example, task like "Model Design" needs to be split into smaller tasks to give us a more realistic timeline and make it easier to divide our work.
