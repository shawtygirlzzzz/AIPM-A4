## Reflection

# Week 07 Reflection

**1. How does effective communication reduce project risks?**
Effective communication is essential for the **Development Team** to manage technical risks. By utilizing **daily stand-ups via MS Teams** and **GitHub** for code updates, the team ensures that everyone is aligned on "API integration" and "task definitions." This transparency reduces the risk of work duplication or integration conflicts, which directly addresses the team's expectation for "clear task assignments" and "technical support".

**2. Which stakeholder is most critical to your project’s success and why?**
The **Course Lecturer** is the most critical stakeholder to the project's success. Classified as **High Power / High Interest**, they hold the ultimate authority over the project's acceptance through grading. While End Users are important for usability, the project cannot be considered a success if it fails to meet the **learning outcomes and rubric requirements** set by the Lecturer. Therefore, the engagement strategy focuses heavily on managing this stakeholder closely through strict adherence to submission guidelines and formatting.
