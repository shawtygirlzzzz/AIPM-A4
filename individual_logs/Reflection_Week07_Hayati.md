## Reflection

# Week 07 Reflection

**1. How does effective communication reduce project risks?**
Effective communication plays a crucial role in helping the Development Team manage technical risks. Through daily stand-up meetings on MS Teams and regular code updates on GitHub, the team stays aligned on API integration and task responsibilities. This level of transparency minimizes the chances of duplicated work or integration issues, while meeting the team’s expectations for clear task allocation and adequate technical support.

**2. Which stakeholder is most critical to your project’s success and why?**
The Course Lecturer is the most influential stakeholder in determining the success of the project. Identified as a High Power / High Interest stakeholder, the Lecturer has final authority over project acceptance through assessment and grading. Although End Users play an important role in usability considerations, the project cannot be deemed successful unless it fulfills the learning outcomes and rubric criteria established by the Lecturer. Consequently, the engagement strategy prioritizes close management of this stakeholder by strictly following all submission requirements and formatting guidelines.
