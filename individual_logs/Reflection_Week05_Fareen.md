## Reflection

1.	Which project phase has the highest cost and why?
   The Model Development project phase has the highest cost at RM 425. This is because this phase involves the most core, technical work which are developing data preprocessing script cost RM200 and this is often a complex and time-consuming task requiring higher-skilled labor, do training the predictive model and evaluating model performance is critical part to ensure the model meets objectives.
   
   
2.	How could you reduce costs without affecting quality?

  	I would reduce costs without affecting quality by identify tasks that can be performed by an individual with a lower hourly rate such as Develop data preprocessing script 8 hours for RM25 per hour could be partially handled by a junior developer or analyst at a lower rate so the cost could decrease.
   
3.	How does resource allocation influence your schedule and overall success?
   
   The resource allocation could influence my schedule and overall success by specialized resources. Tasks requiring highly specialized resources like the AI Engineer for 8 hours must be scheduled carefully. If the resource is not available when needed, the schedule will immediately slip.
