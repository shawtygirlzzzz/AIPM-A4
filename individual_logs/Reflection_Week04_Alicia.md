## Reflection

### 1. Which phase of your project had the most subtasks?  
The *Model Design & Training* phase had the most subtasks. It involved collecting user commands for NLP intent recognition, preprocessing the dataset, training the intent recognition model, and testing its accuracy. This phase required multiple iterations to achieve consistent results, which made it the most detailed part of the project.

### 2. How did breaking tasks down help you plan better?
Breaking the project into smaller subtasks helped me see the logical flow of work — from data gathering to model deployment. It became clearer which tasks depended on others (for example, data collection must be completed before training). It also made task ownership easier to manage and reduced confusion during collaboration.

### 3. What would you adjust in your project schedule next week?
Next week, I would allocate more time for integration testing between the trained model and the Streamlit dashboard. This will ensure that the NLP model functions smoothly in the dashboard interface. I would also start preparing parts of the project report earlier to avoid last-minute rushing before submission.
