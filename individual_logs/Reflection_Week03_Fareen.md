## Reflection

The most challenging part of building the schedule is to accurately estimating the duration and sequencing the dependecies between core AI project task such as model training and data collection because these two parts need to ensure the data collection was complete before start the model design.

Github served as the centre platform for version control and documentation management. Github is to make sure everyone had access to the single, latest, approved version of the project plan include project planner in Excel format and crucial scope document(project_scope.md).MS Teams is the platfrom for immediate communication and feedback for all of group members. We used team channel to post the project planner in xlsx format and tagging team member for the feedback.
