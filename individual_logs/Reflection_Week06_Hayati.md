## Reflection
### 1. Which quality criterion do you think will be hardest to achieve?
The hardest quality criterion to achieve is the intent model accuracy of ≥ 90%, because it depends heavily on having a large, clean, and balanced dataset, which is still pending. This requirement is also marked as the highest-risk item in the risk register, meaning it is both difficult to reach and critical to overall system performance.

### 2. Which risk poses the greatest threat to your project and why?
The greatest threat is R2: the intent model failing to reach 90% accuracy because it has the highest risk score and directly affects the core functionality of the Telegram bot. If the model misinterprets user commands, the entire system becomes unreliable, leading to delays in integration and reduced project success.

### 3. How does quality management support project success?
Quality management supports project success by ensuring the model, bot, and dashboard all meet performance, usability, and reliability standards. It catches issues early, reduces rework, and keeps the system consistent across components, helping the final product function smoothly and delivering a better experience for users.
