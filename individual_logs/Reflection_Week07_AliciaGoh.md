## Reflection

### 1. How does effective communication reduce project risks?
Effective communication acts as an early warning system for our project. [cite_start]By enforcing **daily stand-ups** and clear **GitHub commit messages**, we ensure that technical blockers (such as merge conflicts or API errors) are identified immediately rather than discovering them right before the deadline[cite: 61]. This prevents "silos" where team members might waste time working on the wrong requirements, thereby reducing the risk of late submission or failing to meet the Course Coordinator's rubric.

### 2. Which stakeholder is most critical to your project’s success and why?
[cite_start]The **Development Team** (Hor Ying Huai, Fareen Nathrah, Siti Nuurin Hayati) is the most critical stakeholder group for this project's success[cite: 62]. While the Course Coordinator holds the grading power, the project physically cannot exist without the Development Team's execution. Their engagement is vital because we are building a technical AI product; if they lose interest or fail to communicate technical difficulties, the GitHub repository will stay empty, and we will have nothing to validate with End Users or submit for grading.
