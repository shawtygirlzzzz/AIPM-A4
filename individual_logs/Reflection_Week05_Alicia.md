## Reflection

#### 1. Which project phase has the highest cost and why?
The AI integration phase has the highest cost because it involves using GPT APIs, configuring the model for intelligent task understanding, and testing its interaction quality through Streamlit and Telegram.

#### 2. How could you reduce costs without affecting quality?
Costs can be reduced by:
- Using free-tier API tokens during development.
- Testing locally before deploying to RepoCloud to minimize server usage.
- Automating testing scripts to reduce QA time.

#### 3. How does resource allocation influence your schedule and overall success?
Proper resource allocation ensures parallel development between backend and frontend teams, allowing faster progress. Assigning specific roles (AI engineer, backend developer, UI designer) helps avoid bottlenecks and ensures each component — AI logic, database, and interface — is delivered on time.
