## Reflection

# Week 08 Reflection

**1. What planning activity helped most in monitoring progress?**
The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) with clearly defined dependencies (Week 04) proved to be the most valuable tool. By explicitly identifying Model Training as a prerequisite for Model Evaluation, the team was able to quickly understand why Task 5.1 was delayed, despite the task owner (Hor Ying Huai) being prepared to proceed. Without this dependency mapping, responsibility for the delay could have been incorrectly assigned.

**2. What would you do differently in future projects?**
I would manage the time specifically for data preparation and model tuning activities. In AI projects, training outcomes are inherently unpredictable, making the fixed 3-day allocation for Fine-tuning (Task 4.2) overly optimistic. Moving forward, I plan to include a 20% time buffer for all machine learning–related tasks to better manage this uncertainty.
