## Reflection

### 1. Which phase of your project had the most subtasks?
The Development phase had the most subtasks because it includes building multiple components such as the Telegram bot, NLP model, backend API and Streamlit dashboard. Each required coordination and integration which made it the most detailed and time-consuming phase.

### 2. How did breaking tasks down help you plan better?
Breaking tasks down made the schedule clearer and more realistic. It helped identify dependencies between tasks, such as completing the dataset before model training and allowed each member to focus on specific deliverables without overlapping.

### 3. What would you adjust in your project schedule next week?
I plan to allocate more time for testing and debugging the reminder module, as real-time notifications may require adjustments. I’ll also review the timeline to ensure every phase has enough buffer days for integration and error handling.
