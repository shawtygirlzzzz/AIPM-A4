## Reflection

### 1. What did I contribute this week?
This week, I worked on setting up the GitHub repository for the AI To-Do List System and initialized the project structure in VS Code. I contributed to the frontend design and integrated the basic functionality for task creation, editing, and deletion. Additionally, I tested the connection between the interface and the backend to ensure smooth data flow and functionality.

### 2. What did I learn about collaboration or planning?
I learned the importance of version control and how GitHub facilitates teamwork by allowing everyone to contribute without overwriting each other’s work. Planning and assigning tasks clearly within the team helps avoid confusion and makes collaboration smoother. I also realized that regular communication and progress tracking are key to maintaining a well-organized development process.

### 3. What challenges did I face?
One of the challenges I faced was connecting the local project to the remote GitHub repository correctly. There were also some issues with syncing updates and managing merge conflicts. Another difficulty was ensuring that the AI task suggestions feature integrated well with the existing interface without breaking any components.

### 4. What will I focus on next week?
Next week, I will focus on improving the AI module to make task recommendations more personalized and efficient. I also plan to refine the UI/UX design for a smoother user experience and ensure that all features are tested thoroughly before final submission. Additionally, I aim to write clearer documentation for future development and maintenance.
