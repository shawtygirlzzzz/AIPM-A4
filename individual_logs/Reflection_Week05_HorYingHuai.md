## Reflection
### 1. Which project phase has the highest cost and why?
The Model Development phase has the highest cost because it involves building the AI assistant and connecting it with the chat interface. This phase requires both human and software resources such as the AI Engineer and tools like GPT model, Streamlit, and Telegram API which demand significant development time and technical integration. Since AI model connection and chat interaction are complex and time-consuming tasks, they contribute the most to the project’s total cost.

### 2. How could you reduce costs without affecting quality?
Costs can be minimized by using open-source tools such as FastAPI, Supabase, and Streamlit instead of commercial software, utilizing free cloud services (e.g., Google Colab or limited-tier RepoCloud servers) during model training and deployment, reusing tested code modules across tasks to reduce development time and managing human resources efficiently by assigning backend and AI developers specific focused hours (e.g., 6–8 hours per task) to prevent overtime.  

### 3. How does resource allocation influence your schedule and overall success?
Proper resource allocation ensures smooth workflow and balanced workload distribution by assigning skilled members like backend developers for database design and AI engineers for assistant integration to prevents delays. Furthermore, scheduling QA testers and presenters later in the project helps maintain an efficient sequence from development to presentation. Lastly, clearly defined software and hardware resources (e.g., RepoCloud Server, Google Calendar API) avoid idle time and system bottlenecks.
