## Reflection

# Week 08 Reflection

**1. What planning activity helped most in monitoring progress?**
The **WBS with defined dependencies** (Week 04) was the most useful tool. Because we clearly linked "Model Training" as a predecessor to "Model Evaluation," we could immediately see why Task 5.1 was stalled even though the owner (Hor Ying Huai) was ready to work. Without this link, we might have blamed the wrong person for the delay.

**2. What would you do differently in future projects?**
I would include **management reserve (buffer time)** specifically for data cleaning and model tuning. In AI projects, training results are unpredictable. Allocating a strict 3-day window for "Fine-tuning" (Task 4.2) without any slack was too optimistic. In the future, I will add a 20% time buffer to all ML-related tasks.
