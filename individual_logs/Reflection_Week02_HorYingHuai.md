## Reflection

### 1. What did I contribute this week?
This week, I helped my team organize our GitHub repository by creating folders and adding README files. I also worked on writing the draft for our project concept statement, project workflow diagram and shared my ideas during the team discussion on MS Teams. In addition, I uploaded the mind map from Week 01 to the /docs/ folder.

### 2. What did I learn about collaboration or planning?
I learned that good communication is very important when working in a team. Everyone needs to know what to do and when to do it. Using GitHub and MS Teams helped us stay updated and avoid doing the same work twice. I also learned that planning early saves a lot of time later.

### 3. What challenges did I face?
At first, I found it a bit confusing to use GitHub for teamwork because we had to make sure we didn’t overwrite each other’s work. Sometimes, the files didn’t upload correctly or we had small merge issues. It also took some time for everyone to agree on the final project idea.

### 4. What will I focus on next week?
Next week, I want to learn more about the AI methods we might use for our project so I can understand the technical part better. I plan to improve the logic behind the AI features to make them more accurate and practical. I will also continue improving how I use GitHub to make team collaboration smoother. In addition, I will start preparing documentation on how the system works so it will be easier for others to understand and continue the project later.
