## Reflection
### 1. Which quality criterion do you think will be hardest to achieve?
The most difficult quality criterion is ensuring consistent and accurate chatbot responses because the replies depend on an external n8n webhook and the LLM,which can behave unpredictably unlike UI or database functions the response quality is not fully under our control.

### 2. Which risk poses the greatest threat to your project and why?
The main risk is technical failure of external services such as Supabase or the n8n webhook, which the entire app depends on. If either becomes unreachable, task management and the chatbot both fail, making the system unusable.

### 3. How does quality management support project success?
Quality management ensures clear testing criteria, reduces errors, and helps identify issues early especially with database operations and the chatbot workflow. This improves reliability and increases the chance the app performs well during demonstration and real use.
