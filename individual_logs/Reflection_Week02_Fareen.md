## Reflection

### 1.	What did I contribute this week?
This week, I helped my team organize Github repository by creating folder docs and include project concept markdown file,references markdown and project workflow diagram using Miro platform.

### 2.	What did I learn about collaboration or planning?
I learned good communication in project planning is important.We also used MS Teams platform to discuss and brainstorming idea of project properly.

### 3.	What challenges did I face?
I faced challenges in how to upload files in the Github repository because I rarely used Github platform for collaboration on codes and documentation of the project.There have some issues on how to merge the file in the Github platform.

### 4.	What will I focus on next week?
Next week, I will be more focusing on the structure of the project, how the AI approach functions in the project. Then, I will also discussing on technical part of the project, starting with the backend implementation and then designing the frontend of the system.
