## Reflection
### 1. Which project phase has the highest cost and why?
The Model Development phase incurs the highest cost as it focuses on creating the AI assistant and integrating it with the chat interface. This stage demands substantial human and software resources including the expertise of an AI Engineer and the use of tools like the GPT model, Streamlit and the Telegram API which require extensive development time and technical effort. Due to the complexity and time intensive nature of AI model integration and chat interaction, this phase contributes the most to the overall project cost.

### 2. How could you reduce costs without affecting quality?
Project costs can be reduced by leveraging open source frameworks like FastAPI, Supabase and Streamlit instead of paid software. Additionally, reusing validated code components across multiple tasks can shorten development time, while efficient human resource management—such as assigning backend and AI developers specific, focused work periods can help prevent overtime and further control expenses. 

### 3. How does resource allocation influence your schedule and overall success?
Effective resource allocation promotes a smooth workflow and balanced task distribution such as backend developers for database design and AI engineers for system integration to minimize delays. Additionally, scheduling QA testers and presenters toward the later stages of the project helps maintain a logical and efficient flow from development to final presentation. Finally, clearly specifying software and hardware resources helps prevent downtime and system bottlenecks.
