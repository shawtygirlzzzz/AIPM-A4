## Reflection
### 1. Which project phase has the highest cost and why?
The Model Development phase incurs the highest cost as it focuses on creating the AI assistant and integrating it with the chat interface. This stage demands substantial human and software resources, including the expertise of an AI Engineer and the use of tools like the GPT model, Streamlit, and the Telegram API, all of which require extensive development time and technical effort. Due to the complexity and time-intensive nature of AI model integration and chat interaction, this phase contributes the most to the overall project cost.

### 2. How could you reduce costs without affecting quality?
Costs can be minimized by using open-source tools such as FastAPI, Supabase, and Streamlit instead of commercial software, utilizing free cloud services (e.g., Google Colab or limited-tier RepoCloud servers) during model training and deployment, reusing tested code modules across tasks to reduce development time and managing human resources efficiently by assigning backend and AI developers specific focused hours (e.g., 6–8 hours per task) to prevent overtime.  

### 3. How does resource allocation influence your schedule and overall success?
Proper resource allocation ensures smooth workflow and balanced workload distribution by assigning skilled members like backend developers for database design and AI engineers for assistant integration to prevents delays. Furthermore, scheduling QA testers and presenters later in the project helps maintain an efficient sequence from development to presentation. Lastly, clearly defined software and hardware resources (e.g., RepoCloud Server, Google Calendar API) avoid idle time and system bottlenecks.
