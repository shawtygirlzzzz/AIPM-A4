## Reflection

### 1. What was the most challenging part of building the schedule?
The most challenging part of building the schedule was organizing the tasks in a logical sequence and estimating realistic durations for each activity. We had to avoid overlaps and delays by adjusting the timeline to fit the project’s scope while ensuring everyone’s workload was balanced.

### 2. How did GitHub and Teams support your collaboration?
GitHub helped to keep our project files organized, especially when multiple members updated documents. While Microsoft Teams served as our main communication platform for us to shared updates, uploaded the Excel project plan and discussed progress in real time.

### 3. What tasks will you refine next week?
Next week we will focus on defining clearer technical requirements and improving the structure of our AI model to ensure it aligns with the project objectives.
