## Reflection

### 1. What did I contribute this week?
This week, my team and I brainstorm and shared our ideas for our group project. I helped my team worked on writing the draft for our project concept statement. Additionaly , I create and organize to setup project repository structure.

### 2. What did I learn about collaboration or planning?
I learned that we need to distribute the task equally and communicate with each other. I also learned that we need to organize the project based on milestone to make sure there is a progress.

### 3. What challenges did I face?
The using of GitHub is a bit difficult at first but I think I can managed and get use to it through out the process of our project.

Next week, I want to focus on the module of our project and task distribution between group members. I want to learn more about Artificial Intelligence that will be apply in our project.
