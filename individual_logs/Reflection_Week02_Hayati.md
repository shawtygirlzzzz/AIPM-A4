## Reflection

### 1. What did I contribute this week?
This week, my team and I brainstorm and shared our ideas for our group project. I helped my team worked on writing the draft for our project concept statement. Additionaly , I create and organize to setup project repository structure.

### 2. What did I learn about collaboration or planning?
I learned that we need to distribute the task equally and communicate with each other. I also learned that we need to organize the project based on milestone to make sure 

### 3. What challenges did I face?
At first, I found it a bit confusing to use GitHub for teamwork because we had to make sure we didn’t overwrite each other’s work. Sometimes, the files didn’t upload correctly or we had small merge issues. It also took some time for everyone to agree on the final project idea.

### 4. What will I focus on next week?
Next week, I want to learn more about the AI methods we might use for our project so I can understand the technical part better. I plan to improve the logic behind the AI features to make them more accurate and practical. I will also continue improving how I use GitHub to make team collaboration smoother. In addition, I will start preparing documentation on how the system works so it will be easier for others to understand and continue the project later.
