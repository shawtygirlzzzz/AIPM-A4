#Project Concept Statement
##Problem Statement
<Many users struggle with managing daily tasks effectively due to a lack of time or motivation. Traditional to-do list applications require manual input and reminders, which can be tedious and easily ignored. This project develops an AI assistant that can understand user commands naturally, manage tasks efficiently and remind users automatically.>

##Objectives
<- Develop an AI-based to-do list system that can understand user text input through natural language.
- Enable users to add, edit, delete and mark tasks as completed through a chat interface (e.g. Telegram.
- To integrate a reminder and notification module that alerts users about upcoming or overdue tasks.
- To enhance user productivity using AI-driven intent recognition and entity extraction.>

##Proposed Approach
<Use Telegram by sending natural language text commands or through the Streamlit for a more visual and user friendly experience, where they can view, manage and track tasks in real time.>

##Expected Outcome
<Improved task management efficiency, user engagement and productivity through personalized reminders that help reduce missed tasks.>
